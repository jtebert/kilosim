Kilosim is a fast, lightweight, pseudo-physical* C++ simulator for Kilobot robots. Notable benefits include:

- Pseudo-physical model means fast simulation for high-throughput
- Easily re-use code written for Kilobots, using the same Kilolib API
- Includes support for ambient light sensing
- Included `Logger` to easily to save experiment parameters in log continuous state data
- Cross-platform `Viewer` for debugging and recording simulations
- Easy configuration with JSON files to run multiple trials and varied experiments
- *[In progress]* Parallelization with OpenMP

\* *Pseudo-physical means that it is spatial and handles issues like collisions in a functional but hand-wavy manner. We make no attempt to accurately model true physical interactions. If you want to see what this means, run an example simulation with the Viewer.*

Note that this project is currently in a pre-release state and may still contain bugs, incomplete documentation, and missing features. If you have issues using the code, contact the developers or [open an issue](https://github.com/jtebert/kilosim/issues/new).

## Installing and Using

**NOTE:** We have tested Kilosim primarily on Ubuntu. Although CMake makes it possible to use across operating systems, we have not thoroughly tested this beyond Linux. Installation of dependencies will differ depending on your system.

You can either [clone the repository from GitHub](https://github.com/jtebert/kilosim) or [download the latest release](https://github.com/jtebert/kilosim/releases).

### Dependencies

[HDF5](https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/HDF5), [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php), and [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/). Install on Ubuntu-like systems with:

    sudo apt install libsfml-dev libhdf5-dev libomp-dev

### Using static library

This is the primary way of using kilosim.

If your project uses `cmake`, then incorporating kilosim is easy!

Just add the following lines to your `CMakeLists.txt` file:

    add_subdirectory(path/to/kilosim EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)
    target_link_libraries(your_executable_target PRIVATE kilosim)

And everything will just work.

For a more detailed example, see the [Kilosim Demo repository](https://github.com/jtebert/kilosim-demo).

### Compile

Compiling the library explicitly as follows is only necessary to run its tests
and generate its documentation.

To compile, copy and paste the following:

    mkdir build  # Create a build directory
    cd build  # Move into build directory
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../ ..  #Configure for your system
    make  # Build the library (equivalent to `make kilosim`)
    make install  # Install the library to that indicated by `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` above
    cd ..  # Move back to source directory

If you want to generate more than the library, you can alternatively run:

    make kilosim       # Build library
    make docs          # Build documentation (optional)
    make install       # Install all the components generated by the above commands

To clean up the build enter the source directory and run:

    rm -rf build bin lib

Flags:

 * `-DSANITIZE_ADDRESS=On`: Use address sanitizer to check memory safety

Use flags like so:

    cmake -DSANITIZE_ADDRESS=ON ..

Compatibility:

 * g++ 5   - doesn't work
 * g++ 7.3 - works
 * g++ 8.1 - fails due to compiler issue(?)
 * g++ 8.3 - works
 * g++ 9.2.1 - works

### Run

In addition to the static library, we provide an executable example to test your installation.

Run the examples generated by `make` and `make install`:

    ./bin/kilosim_example examples/exampleConfig.json

## Configuration and Parameters

Configuration files are defined as JSON files and can be loaded with a ConfigParser. The contents of flat JSON files can be automatically saved with your data using the Logger. (Support for saving JSON objects and arrays to HDF5 may be added in the future if someone needs/wants it.)

There are no fixed requirements for the contents of the configuration files; it's an un-opinionated convenience tool for importing and using whatever (atomic) parameters you want.

## Support

If you are having issues installing or using the simulator, [open an issue](https://github.com/jtebert/kilosim/issues/new) or [email Julia](mailto:julia@juliaebert.com).

### Known Issues

- Fails with GCC 8 (We suspect this is a GCC bug; see [issue #23](https://github.com/jtebert/kilosim/issues/23).) **Workaround:** Change your GCC version.
- Viewer does not work over SSH
