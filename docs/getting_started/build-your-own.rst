## Configuration and Parameters

Configuration files are defined as JSON files and can be loaded with a ConfigParser. The contents of flat JSON files can be automatically saved with your data using the Logger. (Support for saving JSON objects and arrays to HDF5 may be added in the future if someone needs/wants it.)

There are no fixed requirements for the contents of the configuration files; it's an un-opinionated convenience tool for importing and using whatever (atomic) parameters you want.
