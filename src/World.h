/*!
 * The `World` provides the base environment for running simulations. It
 * represents a two-dimensional bounded arena for simulating Kilobots.
 *
 * The user can configure the World dimensions and the monochrome light
 * intensity at every point in the World (with a `LightPattern`), and add
 * `Robot`s to the World to simulate.
 *
 * After initial configuration, the simulation is run simply by invoking the
 * `step()` method, which processes a single time step (1/32 second, by default)
 * for all `Robot`s.
 *
 * References to a `World` are used by both the `Logger` (to save information
 * about the `Robot`s during simulation) and the `Viewer` (to visualize the
 * simulation).
 *
 * It manages fixed-step simulated control over all `Robot`s placed in it.
